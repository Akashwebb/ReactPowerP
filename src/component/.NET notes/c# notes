# C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".
1. It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
2. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit and compile code.

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}

Line 1: using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.

Line 2: A blank line. C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.

Line 3: namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.

Line 4: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

Line 5: class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.

const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', age: 20 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', age: 30 },
  { id: 4, name: 'David', age: 25 }
];


function filterUsersByAge(users, targetAge) {
  return users.filter(user => {
    for (const key in user) {
      if (key === 'age' && user[key] === targetAge) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  });
}


const result = filterUsersByAge(users, 25);
console.log(result);
